	// that have already terminated by the time the parent calls wait,
	// but the kernel must still allow the parent to retrieve its childâ€™s exit status,
	// or learn that the child was terminated by the kernel.

	// pid does not refer to a direct child of the calling process.
	// pid is a direct child of the calling process if and only if the calling process received pid as a return value from a successful call to fork.
	// Note that children are not inherited: if A spawns child B and B spawns child process C, then A cannot wait for C, even if B is dead.
	// A call to wait(C) by process A must fail. Similarly, orphaned processes are not assigned to a new parent if their parent process exits before they do.

	// The process that calls wait has already called wait on pid. That is, a process may wait for any given child at most once.

	// Processes may spawn any number of children, wait for them in any order, and may even exit without having waited for some or all of their children.
	// Your design should consider all the ways in which waits can occur. All of a process's resources, including its struct thread,
	// must be freed whether its parent ever waits for it or not, and regardless of whether the child exits before or after its parent.
	// You must ensure that Pintos does not terminate until the initial process exits.
	// The supplied Pintos code tries to do this by calling process_wait() (in userprog/process.c) from main() (in threads/init.c).
	// We suggest that you implement process_wait() according to the comment at the top of the function and then implement the wait system call in terms of process_wait().

	// In particular, it is not safe to call into the file system code provided in the filesys directory from multiple threads at once.
	// Your system call implementation must treat the file system code as a critical section.
	// Don't forget that process_exec() also accesses files. For now, we recommend against modifying code in the filesys directory.

	// We have provided you a user-level function for each system call in lib/user/syscall.c.
	// These provide a way for user processes to invoke each system call from a C program.
	// Each uses a little inline assembly code to invoke the system call and (if appropriate) returns the system call's return value.

	// When you're done with this part, and forevermore, Pintos should be bulletproof.
	// Nothing that a user program can do should ever cause the OS to crash, panic, fail an assertion, or otherwise malfunction.
	// It is important to emphasize this point: our tests will try to break your system calls in many, many ways.
	// You need to think of all the corner cases and handle them.
	// The sole way a user program should be able to cause the OS to halt is by invoking the halt system call.

	// If a system call is passed an invalid argument, acceptable options include returning an error value
	// (for those calls that return a value), returning an undefined value, or terminating the process.
